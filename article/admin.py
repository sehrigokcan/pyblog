#1- we need to save this model in the settings.py page in the INSTALLED_APP section.

#2- Each time we create a new model, we need to run the command 'python manage.py 
# makemigrations' from the terminal. After running this command the 0001_initial.py 
# file will occur in under the migrations file.

#3- When we run the command 'python manage.py migration' from the terminal, the tables - 
# will be created  in the admin panel acording to the 0001_initial.py database.
